It produces sequence files\r\ncontaining XML representations of the document annotation. The GATE application is a archive file with an\r\napplication .xgapp file in its root directory. This application is copied to HDFS and placed into the distributed\r\ncache.\r\n\r\nThe first positional argument is the GATE application. Subsequent positional arguments are input directories,\r\nexcept for the final positional argument, which is the output directory. A sample command might be\r\n\r\n\thadoop jar Hadoop-GATE-1.0.jar wpmcn.gate.hadoop.HadoopGATE ANNIE.zip input output\r\n\r\nThis project uses the new Hadoop API. It is built with Maven and demonstrates how to use Maven to package all the\r\nGATE dependencies into a single jar file.\r\n\r\nThe [Behemoth](https://github.com/jnioche/behemoth) project also runs GATE on Hadoop.","name":"Hadoop-gate","tagline":"A Hadoop job that runs GATE applications"}
